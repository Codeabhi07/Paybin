# Paybin
A multi-utility Project which whose primary aim is to promote cleanliness by facilitating the common mass with self-operable trash can which rewards the for every bit they do to clean the environment and make this earth a greener place.

In this era of advancing technologies are impacting lives in as much ways as possible. We thought of carrying forward this legacy by implementing a tinge of Cloud and IoT to the very basic dustbins we use in our day to day lives.

We've incorporated a programmatically assembled hardware device in our dustbin prototype incorporated with sensors. When a citizen dumps any kind of trash into the dustbin, it senses the grabage and computes a incentive on the basis of various parameters and displays an OTP on the Binscreen.
Upon entering the OTP on the the App Interface, the logged in user is credited the Reward Point which can be redeemed in local civic bodies for availing municipal services.
